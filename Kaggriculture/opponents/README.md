Real third-party Kaggriculture agents kept around as fixed benchmarks --
not part of the improvement loop itself (`evaluation/acceptance_gate.py`
only judges baseline-vs-candidate), but useful as an external strength
check via `game.kaggriculture_env.play_match(our_agent, "opponents/X/main.py", ...)`.

## submission_27

A public solution (docstring credits a "public v20 Notebook" and
prvsiyan's "The Moon Counts Melons" Notebook). Decompiled for analysis
(the `_ACTIONS` blob is base85 + zlib + JSON, not encrypted -- fully
reversible with the standard library) to understand its strategy:

- **Frozen 719-step scripted route**: a precomputed sequence of
  farmer/hand/market actions per turn, presumably produced by offline
  search/optimization. Farm operations (movement, planting, buying,
  hiring, building) do **not** react to the opponent or live game state at
  all -- only the step index.
- **Weed repair**: if the script's next PLANT/BUILD_PASTURE would land on
  a weed tile, DIG first and replay the intended action a few turns later.
- **Mirror detection + market front-running**: a small logistic-regression
  model estimates whether the opponent's farm looks like a mirror of its
  own, then reorders (not resizes) its scripted SELL orders by live price
  x opponent-exposure so the highest-value items go first when a turn's
  orders exceed `maxMarketOrdersPerTurn`.
- **Terminal dump-sell**: sells everything left in the shed on the last
  turn (unsold inventory doesn't count toward the final score).
- Decoded schedule: 719 total actions, 62 BUY_SEED (mostly wheat, then
  melon and strawberry from day ~4), 10 BUY_ANIMAL (8 cow, 2 sheep -- milk
  and wool are steady, low-marginal-cost income once placed and fed,
  unlike crops which need a fresh seed + full grow cycle every harvest),
  284 HIRE calls (a large, sustained hand roster), and 2 BUY_LAND buys
  (day ~7 and ~11, expanding to 3 of the 4 quadrants).

## Benchmark results

vs. `opponents/submission_27/main.py`, 3 seeds, 720-turn games:

| version | our final bank | submission_27 final bank | deficit |
|---|---|---|---|
| single-tile carrot loop (pre-session baseline) | $3,504 | $186,169 | ~53x |
| v3: multi-unit crop scale-up (10 hands, melon/wheat) | ~$19,900-20,100 | ~$174,000-189,000 | ~9x |
| v4: v3 + cow/sheep husbandry | ~$27,600-29,700 | ~$163,000-196,000 | ~6x |

Each round closed the gap further but none has won yet.

1. ~~**Animal husbandry** (cow/sheep -> milk/wool)~~ -- **done in v4**:
   compounding income from one $400-500 purchase instead of paying a
   fresh seed cost every harvest cycle. Required a dedicated caretaker
   unit to `PICKUP` the animal from the shed (animals bought via
   `BUY_ANIMAL` land in the shed, not directly on a tile) and physically
   carry `WHEAT` in inventory daily to `FEED` (unlike seeds, wheat for
   feeding is **not** auto-available -- see `_apply_unit_action`'s `FEED`
   handler in the installed `kaggle_environments` package).

## Round 4: scaling animals further (rejected, twice)

Tried to push from v4's 1 cow + 1 sheep toward submission_27's 8 cow + 2
sheep. Three attempts, each measured head-to-head against v4 over 10 real
720-turn games via `evaluation/compare_agents.py`:

1. **TARGET_HANDS 10 -> 18 + 3 caretakers (9 animals) + land purchases.**
   Catastrophic: `HIRE` cost is `mult * fib(n_already_hired_today)`, and
   hands must be re-hired from scratch every day (they disappear
   overnight). Reaching 18 hires in one day costs **$6,764**, vs. $143 for
   10 -- the fib curve, not tile space, is the real ceiling on headcount.
   The run never even reached the caretaker slots (indices 15-17), so
   `animal_cost` stayed exactly $0, and $3,000 got spent on land for
   tiles we never needed. This is also why submission_27 -- despite
   controlling far more land and 10 animals -- only issues ~9-10 HIRE
   calls/day on average (284 total / 30 days), not dozens: the same fib
   ceiling applies to it too.
2. **TARGET_HANDS 10 -> 12 (2 caretakers, 6 animals), no land.** Better,
   but $376/day in hire cost alone during the ~12-day window before melon
   first matures (little income yet) burns the $3,000 starting bank
   before any animal or seed spending is even considered. Hand count
   collapsed unpredictably once cash ran out, leaving tiles/animals
   untended some days -> dead crops, escaped animals, compounding losses.
3. **Kept TARGET_HANDS at 10 (v4's proven $143/day), reallocated 2 of
   those 10 hands from crop tiles to a second caretaker** (6 animals: 4
   cow + 2 sheep, one fewer melon tile) **+ a $1,500 cash reserve** so
   animal purchases can't eat into tomorrow's hire/feed money, **+
   staggering the second caretaker's animal purchases** by extra days.
   This got the hire economics right (hand count stayed flat at 10 all
   game, no more cash collapse) and genuinely raised revenue (milk+wool
   revenue: $23,133 vs. v4's $14,448; total revenue: ~$44,750 vs. v4's
   $40,575) -- but **still lost head-to-head, -$3,561 mean profit,
   REJECTED**. Root cause, found by diffing tile state turn-by-turn: 2 of
   the second caretaker's 3 animals escaped simultaneously on day 13,
   well after the cash-crunch window and well after the staggering delay
   -- i.e. not a money problem at all. The likely cause is the shared
   hand-spawn mechanic (hands respawn "at the least-crowded shed-adjacent
   slot" each day, which varies with how many *other* hands are also
   spawning that day): on a day where that caretaker spawned unusually
   far from its 3 pastures, it may not have had enough of its 24 turns
   left to reach and feed all three, missing 2 consecutive days for the
   same 2 animals. The one-time $400-500 purchase becomes a total loss on
   escape, which combined with 6 animals' recurring feed cost (~$150-270/
   day bought via `BUY_PRODUCT`, since growing enough wheat ourselves to
   self-supply would cost more melon tiles than it's worth) outweighed
   the extra revenue.

**Net conclusion**: more animals only pays off if they don't escape.
Fixing that requires either giving the caretaker a spawn-independent
route (e.g. always reachable from any of the 4 shed-adjacent tiles within
a turn budget that has slack even on a bad spawn) or accepting fewer
animals per caretaker so the daily round-trip has more slack. Left for
the next iteration; `submissions/candidate/main.py` still holds this
round's (rejected) code and `reports/experiment_history.csv` has the
exact numbers for both failed attempts.

## Remaining levers (not yet tried)

2. **Land expansion**, once headcount is no longer the constraint it
   looks like it should be -- v4/v5 both still fit inside the 24-tile NW
   quadrant, so this hasn't been the actual bottleneck yet.
3. **Ongoing crops (strawberry/tomato)** and **goose/egg** for further
   income diversification, matching submission_27's mix.
